## Create the Earthquake Visualization

In this activity, we created an interactive map using Leaflet with earthquake data from the USGS. 
The map visualizes earthquake locations with markers that vary in size based on magnitude and color based on depth. 
We included pop-ups to provide additional information about each earthquake and added a legend to give context to the displayed data. 
This visualization helps to better understand the distribution and characteristics of earthquakes around the world.
